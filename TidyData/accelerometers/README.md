# Welcome to Accelerometer project!

This project is part of coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data". This is a peer
assignment.

This whole project has been built using [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.
net/index.html) and [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). 
This document has been writen using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.
rstudio.com/), a **R** format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents.

The *codeBook.pdf* has been writed using [Knitr](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/
en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr).

This github repository is synced using [Rstudio with Git](https://support.rstudio.com/
hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)


## The Accelerometer project
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will 
find:

* two tidy data sets as *.csv* files in the **data** directory
* one code book *codeBook.pdf* in the **doc** directory. It describes the variables, 
the data and any work done to perform the data cleaning process. 
* one `run_analysis.R` in the *src* directory

Please find below more info and how to load & deploy the project.



## A quick note about ProjectTemplate
[ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.
net/index.html) is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. The package will automate parts of your data analysis project:

* Organizing the files in your project.
* Loading all the R packages you’ll use.
* Loading all of your data sets into memory.
* Munging and preprocessing your data into a form that’s suitable for analysis.
