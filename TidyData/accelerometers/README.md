# Welcome to Accelerometer project!

This project is part of coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data". This is a peer
assignment.

This whole project has been built using [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.
net/index.html) and [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). 
This document has been writen using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.
rstudio.com/), a **R** format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents.


### A quick note about ProjectTemplate
[ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.
net/index.html) is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. The package will automate parts of your data analysis project:

* Organizing the files in your project.
* Loading all the R packages you’ll use.
* Loading all of your data sets into memory.
* Munging and preprocessing your data into a form that’s suitable for analysis.


## The Accelerometer project
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will 
find:

* one tidy data set 
* one **R** script called `run_analysis().R` 
* one code book `CodeBook.Rmd` describing the variables, the data and any work done 
to perform the
data cleaning process
