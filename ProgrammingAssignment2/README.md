### Assignment
This is programmingAssignment2 from coursera/prog-004.

Objective: write a functions able to cache a time-consuming computation. 
In this assignment, we compute the inverse of a matrix with the *solve()*
function.


First function, **makeCacheMatrix()**, is a constructor and returns a list of 
functions to set/get matrix value then set/get its inverse.

All work has been done with [Rstudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/) using its 
integrated git functionnality.
